## Appendix: Measurement Methods

### Success Rate Calculation
```
Success Rate = (Successful Executions / Total Executions) * 100
```

### Average Latency
```
Average Latency = Sum(All Execution Times) / Number of Executions
```

### Resource Utilization
```
CPU Utilization = (CPU Time Used / Total CPU Time Available) * 100
Memory Utilization = (Memory Used / Total Memory) * 100
```

### Quality Score (Manual Review)
```
Quality Score = (Accepted Items / Total Reviewed Items) * 100
```
